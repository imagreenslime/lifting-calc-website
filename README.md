# One-rep-max-website
## Description: A website from scratch that can calculate your one-rep max, your intensity per rep, and DOTS. A frontend composed of javascript(jquery), html, and css, with a backend of Python with the module "Flask". I hope to make more additions to this website like a sets and reps track and etc.

One-rep max calculator: Calculate your one-rep max. A one-rep max is the highest weight you can perform on an exercise for one repetition. The calculator becomes less accurate as the repetitions go up, so for accurate results, go for low reps (1-5) high intensity (80%-100%) of your one-rep max.
 Intensity per rep calculator: After adding in your one-rep max, it shows the percentages of your max weight lifted and the following repetitions, adding them up in the one-rep max calculator. It allows you to see how many reps of a specific weight you would need to do in order to reach a certain intensity.

DOTS Calculator: Calculate how well you would do in a powerlifting setting. The DOTS score is the official ranking measure used in all powerlifting federations. It measures your strength against other powerlifters with different bodyweights and amongst both genders.

## How to run the project: run main.py
